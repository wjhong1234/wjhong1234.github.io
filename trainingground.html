	<p>Interactive Horror Training is a Mobile Virtual Reality Application that can help a user get accustomed to common horror movie tropes, such as jump scares and extremely suspenseful situations. The app has the user in the center of an uncomfortable environment, with eerie music and sounds playing around them. Occasionally, suspenseful situations or a jump scare happens, but instead of a monster or ghost, a kitten or other cute creature will appear instead! </p> <br>

	<p>Some backstory: I personally cannot watch horror movies. If I watch a horror movie, it will haunt me for years to come! It’s been years since I watched a horror movie, so in an attempt to train myself and others to watch horror movies without fear, I decided to create this application.</p> <br>
	<p>As seen in the gallery below, my ideation started with several unrelated ideas. I found some similarities between all the ideas however, such as external controllers (usually other mobile devices), gestures or movements, and environment exploration. After narrowing down some ideas, I realized many of them didn’t draw my interest as much as my horror idea, which allowed the user to immersively stand within a horror video.</p> <br>

    <h1 id="variations">Variations</h1>

    <p>After talking to some peers, I had another brainstorming session alone, combining, updating, or adding to certain ideas. I ended up with another list of ideas. Some of the feelings I wanted to get from these new ideas were suspenseful, creepy, and eerie. While looking over these ideas, it occurred to me that I would have been too scared to test and develop for any of them except for a couple. I found that the ones that didn’t test my courage too much were the ones where I was the monster, or where the goal was to help me become braver.</p> <br>

    <p>I chose the latter idea, and started designing how I wanted it to be like. I took some things from previous ideas to help this one come along, and the final design became Interactive Horror Training.</p> <br>

    <h1 id="development">Development</h1>

    <p>Development was done in the Unity Game Engine. I initially thought about using another device as a controller for a flashlight object, that would allow the user to control which parts of the video are visible, but because of time constraints, implementation of that was not possible. Instead, I had a light where the user was looking, while everywhere else was dark.</p> <br>

    <p>This experience is much better with headphones on, as the surrounding sounds would be much more immersive compared to a mono speaker on most phones, and better without external noises.</p> <br>

    <p>For events that were not jumps scares, I hoped that they would add to the eerie atmosphere, making it feel more like the user was stuck in the middle of a forgotten nowhere, rather than some place safe. The goal was to build suspense before a bigger event occurred.</p> <br>

    <h1 id="finalproduct">Final Product</h1>

    <p>The final product is called "VR Horror Training", a Mobile VR project created for my Human-Computer Interactions II class.</p> <br>
