	<h1 id="define">Defining Hygge</h1> 

	<p>I interpreted hygge as the feeling you get when you're comfortable and cozy, sharing that feeling with friends and family around you. It's both a social and personal experience of relaxation and tenderness. Deep conversations with loved ones, being warm with a full stomach, all those moments in life that emphasize comfort.</p> <br>

	<p>My goal for this project was to create a device to enable or enhance hygge without being intrusive or awkward. I focused on the social aspect of it, researching ways to make conversations last longer, reviving that conversation when it died down, etc. The setting I imagined for this device was a living room or dining space.</p> <br>

	<h1 id="ideation">Ideation</h1>

	<p>I started my ideation with a wide range of different hygge ideas. Some of them were very interesting but seem implausible in the time given. After looking through them all, I assumed I was on the right track, since the common ideas that stemmed from all my ideas were comfort and social interactions. </p> <br>

	<p> An idea that drew my interest more than the others was the idea of enforced hygge. I did some quick sketches for those ideas, but after consulting with my instructor, I felt that it may have been too aggressive, and gave the opposite feeling of hygge.</p> <br>

    <h1 id="variations">Variations</h1>

    <p>From the idea of enforced hygge, I decided to tone it down, and thought about how to make my ideas encourage hygge instead. Some ideas explored how to prevent users from using their devices when others are around, while some ideas assumed all the users were not strangers.</p> <br>

    <p>I found the similarities in my sketches to be with multiple people. Using the Kinect, I decided I needed to track several people at once, finding ways to encourage conversation when it's quiet, or to improve the hygge feeling when there are extended conversations without being intrusive.</p> <br>

					<h3>Variation #1: Spotlight</h3>
        			<p>When a user either doesn't make conversation for a long time (no companions) or plays on their phones, a spotlight appears above them, singling them out. The spotlight only goes away when the individual makes conversation again. Intended use at parties or social gatherings.</p>

					<h3>Variation #2: Fireplace</h3>
        			<p>A projector or large screen acts as a backdrop for a room. The Kinect keeps track of electronics devices that everyone would stack up in a small pile near the Kinect. The more conversation there is, the larger the fire. If anyone takes a phone, the fire would die down, or stop completely.</p>

					<h3>Variation #3: Calming Down</h3>

					<h3>Variation #5: New Meetings</h3>

					<h3>Variation #7: Smelly Hygge</h3>
        			<p>Technology is often inevitable, but trying to incorporate that as hygge somehow is difficult. This idea allows users to be on their devices, used perhaps for gaming or other activities with friends. While that's happening, a good scent will be present. If no conversation happens however, a a bad scent will appear.</p>

    <h1 id="designchoices">Design Choices</h1>

    <p>I chose a fireplace as the main backdrop for chatting because I felt it was lowkey and gave a warm, cozy feeling. If I had some more time I would've opted to add many more backdrops that the users could choose from, switching through them via gestures. When a user pulls out their phone, I chose to use the red message due to other ideas not really being as effective. I found that the red sign drew more attention than any other options.</p> <br>

    <p>For the music, I decided that lowkey, cafe style music was the way to go. From several research papers (credited in the "Credits" section of this report), I read that conversation is enhanced when there is music playing quietly. It helps to pace the conversation, giving the people conversing a beat to speak to. </p> <br>

    <p>When users do not talk, a riddle is displayed. I tried several other techniques, such as conversation prompts, stopping/playing the music, and removing the landscape, but none were as effective (at least for the people who tested this for me) as riddles, which either confused the users, and made them talk about how confused they were, starting them up in conversation again, or prompted a discussion about the riddle, turning into more conversation.</p> <br>

    <p> The fireplace is from a video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RoTpvA9MSw&t=321s">'Fireplace - Full HD - 8 hours crackling logs for Christmas'</a> by Christmas Time on Youtube. The background music is titled 'Duck Soup'</a> by PurplePlanetMusic. A <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/2p-start/Gesture-Control-with-Kinect-and-Unity-made-easy">tutorial</a> was followed for a small portion of this project. This application was created in <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, a game engine created by Unity Technologies, and utilizes the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect">Microsoft Kinect</a> as an input device.</p> <br><br>
