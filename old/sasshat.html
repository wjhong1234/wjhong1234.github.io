            Sass hat is a device that reminds you about the things you forget, with an attitude. It speaks to the wearer, either “complimenting” them when they never forget things, or scolding the wearer when they leave without an important item. <br><br>
            The design of the cap is simple, yet charming, and has tons of personality. The voice of Sasshat was meant to entertain the user, while still being effective at helping the user remember the most important items in life. <br><br>
            The SassHat is both an accessory and a tool, helping you to remember your important tasks while also looking like you’re from the future. It acts like a sassy friend following you around, ensuring you do your chores and helping you remember little things.

            For this project, there was no specific client to cater my design towards. However, I didn’t want to design a product for everyone-- or else it would be interesting to no one. So I chose to design for someone I knew really well.

              I began designing for myself. This allowed me to get as much information I could about what I needed in the limited time we had. I’m a pretty lazy person, and I like to sleep, and not reach for anything too far away from me. I’m also incredibly forgetful, and I tend to ignore the reminders I write down. Following these simple guidelines, I began designing accessories that could aid me in my daily life. <br><br>
              Some of the more interesting ideas included a safety cowl and glasses that changed states depending on the situation it was in. But the idea I decided to develop further was the reminder clip. The initial idea of the reminder clip was a clip that vibrates when you forget something that you normally have with you, such as your phone or wallet. <br><br>
              Over time that idea developed into a hat, and once the kinks were ironed out, it became something more than just a hat that vibrates.
