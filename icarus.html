  <p style="margin-left: 3em; margin-right: 3em">Icarus is a mobile game on the Android OS platform, created for Tina Huynh as her personal button of delight. The game follows Icarus the Cookie as he finds his friends while avoiding dangerous spiders. Navigate Icarus along the rainbow in the clouds, finding 30 of his cookie friends. But be careful-- not everything on the rainbow is pleasant!

Created in Android Studio, this game was designed for Tina Huynh, tailored towards the things she enjoys. With a focus on her love of video games, pastel colours, and cookies, Icarus is meant to combine all of the things that delight her into a single button.

  <p style="margin-left: 3em; margin-right: 3em">The button’s usage was geared toward making Tina feel joy. As such, initial brainstorming of her button led to concepts pertaining to what is perceived as ‘cute’ (ie. bright pastel colors) or ideas that would remind her of her childhood home of Red Deer.</p> <br>

    <p style="margin-left: 3em; margin-right: 3em">Ultimately, her love of video games led me to brainstorm possible fun games, keeping in mind that it had to be implemented in approximately a week. Out of several ideas for smaller scale games, I decided upon a game similar to the classic ‘Racer’ game.</p> <br>

    <p style="margin-left: 3em; margin-right: 3em">Cookies were the first game object to come to mind. Tina loves baking and cookies, so in my mind the player had to be a cookie. Eventually deciding that adding a face made the cookie appear cuter, I made a map to match the intended atmosphere: a basic three-shade pastel coloured rainbow, with fluffy clouds decorating the top and bottom of the map. To add to the character of the map, some happy background music was used, credited to Bensound.</p> <br>
