		<h1>Besieging Armies</h1>

		<!-- talk about the armies besieging castles -->
		<p>To lay siege to a castle or city, armies had to be massive in order to be a threat, especially to larger fortified cities. When the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus laid siege to the city of Carthage during the Third Punic War, his army of 84,000 was matched up against the well fortified city of 400,000 civilians and defenders.</p>

		<!-- talk about attacking armies, siege engines, aggers & other techniques.-->
		<p>But a well equipped army with established supply lines have the advantage in a siege. Besieging armies can wait until the defenders run out of food or equipment, or bombard them with projectiles from siege engines until they surrender. For more on siege engines, <a href="trebuchets.html">click here</a>.</p> 

		<p>There were several methods attacks used to attempt to enter the city or castle. One method was to simply build a giant ramp to scale the walls, called an <i>agger</i>. Built primarily of dirt and stone, aggers were started some distance from the wall, and slowly increased in height until they were nearly the same as the wall. The attackers could then storm the city or castle by going up the ramp and opening the gates.</p>

		<p>Ramps however were not invincible. Defenders could sneak out and dig at the wall, or fire arrows and other projectiles at the builders to slow or stop them, even if they had worksheds to protect them, stones launched at the sheds could easily destroy them. The defenders could also increase the height of the wall where the ramp was being built.</p> 

		<p>Another technique employed by a besieging army was to dig tunnels beneath the castle walls and light combustible materials directly underneath, causing the wall to collapse. This was effective, as this usually meant the siege was won, either because the defenders surrendered, or the attacking army could now enter the city.</p>

		<p>This could only be done if the castle was built on easily dug materials like dirt, and there were ways the defenders could counter this technique. One way is to dig a counter-tunnel, which they could dig into the attacker's mine and destroy it. If a wall collapsed, the defenders could try to place obstacles to prevent the entry of the attacking army, or section off the wall, essentially replacing the destroyed wall further back.</p> 

		<p>Often times the besieging army had the advantage. When the defending army ran low on food or the attackers created a vulnerability in the castle or city, it wasn't uncommon for the defending army to surrender immediately.</p>
