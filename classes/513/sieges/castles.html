		<h1>Defenders of the Castle</h1>

		<!-- talk about castles a lot like the trebuchet section -->
		<p>Castle are one of the most interesting things left behind from the Dark Ages in Europe. The lack of central states left many towns and cities vulnerable to raiding. This eventually led to fortresses and fortified cities being the norm, resulting in magnificent structures such the castles of Warwick and Bodium.</p>

		<p>If the defenders knew a siege was coming, a lot of preparations would be made. Food and Water was of utmost importance, to ensure that the inhabitants did not starve or die of thirst. Food and water shortages during a siege cause major problems for the inhabitants inside, moreso than just starvation. Hungry civilians of a besieged city are more likely to steal or cause trouble. Unhappy civilians or soldiers could simply betray the stronghold, opening the gates or allowing the enemy another way in.</p> 

		<p>Making sure there were enough weapons, projectiles, and other materials such as wood, was also a major part of prepartions. Stocking up a castle or city for defense was not an easy task, but they were often built in a way to make defending them easy.</p>

		<h2>Castles &amp; Fortified Cities</h2>

		<p>The line between a fortified city and castle is blurred, with the main difference being that a city is much larger in size and population. Castles were generally owned by a noble and manned by their soldiers (ranging from a handful to an army, depending on the size), while fortified cities were simply walled and defended cities. They were built to last, and attacking armies if unprepared would generally avoid attacking fortified cities and castles.</p> 

		<p>When attacked, defenders would strengthen the existing fortifications, like adding wooden props (posts) to walls, covering gates and other flammable structures with wet animal hides, perhaps even building castle hoardings. Hoardings were temporary wooden sheds placed on the ramparts of the wall to provide the defenders with a better angle to fire their arrows, as well as adding space on the walls. Castles eventually evolved to include permanent hoardings made of stone, called machicolations.</p>

		<p>Castles themselves were constructed with defense in mind, and employed many different techniques to make defending them easier. The location of castles were important, as you would want the keep of the castle to be as challenging as possible for assailants to reach. If not already surrounded by water, moats were often dug around castles to deter attackers from using siege ladders. A famous example of a moated castle is Caerphilly Castle in South Wales, in which the keep is surrounded by artificial lakes.</p>

		<p>The earliest castle type was called the motte and bailey. It consisted of a keep surrounded by a wall and courtyard, and could be built quickly with wood for temporary control of a location, or permanently with stone. The gatehouses of a keep were amongst the most important parts of a castle. A good castle tended to have several gatehouse within its walls, sectioning off parts of the castle or city to contain attackers in the event of a breach.</p>

		<p>Castles and fortified cities allowed smaller armies to defend themselves from significantly superior numbers. They were built to last, and many remain standing today. Though they no longer act as the primary military stronghold of a lord and his armies, their ruins remain to inspire our fantasies and shape our imaginations.</p>
