		<h1>Sieges</h1>

		<p>Medieval sieges were wars of attrition, where an army blocks a defended fortress or city from external resources or communications, such as food and water. Often times, the goal of the besieging army is to capture the castle or city, sometimes by force, but usually by waiting until the defending inhabitants surrender due to lack of supplies. This can take several weeks or months, sometimes even years. Famously, the (maybe) mythical Siege of Troy by the Greek King Menelaus and his allies, took 10 years before the Greek armies managed to deceive the Trojans and enter the city.</p>

		<!-- sieges happened a lot more often that battles -->
		<p>Pitched battles rarely happen in medieval times, even skirmishes and smaller encounters weren't as common. William the Conquerer was the first King of England, but only won one battle at Hastings. Most battles in war were sieges, and many pitched battles even started because of sieges. For example, in the second Persion Invasion of Greece, the Battle of Salamis was fought to lift the sieges by Persian forces in the Peloponnese.</p>

		<p>Despite battles happening far less often than sieges, battles are usually the focal points of history, where glorious acts of greatness happened. However, sieges arguably had a much larger impact on the world, even if they're often portrayed (and often were) boring and anticlimactic.</p>
