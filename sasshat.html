	<p>Sass hat is a device that reminds you about the things you forget, with an attitude. It speaks to the wearer, either “complimenting” them when they never forget things, or scolding the wearer when they leave without an important item. </p> <br>

	<h1 id="ideation">Ideation</h1>

	<p> The design of the cap is simple, yet charming, and has tons of personality. The voice of Sasshat was meant to entertain the user, while still being effective at helping the user remember the most important items in life.</p> <br>
	<p>The SassHat is both an accessory and a tool, helping you to remember your important tasks while also looking like you’re from the future. It acts like a sassy friend following you around, ensuring you do your chores and helping you remember little things.</p> <br>

    <h1 id="variations">Variations</h1>

    <p>For this project, there was no specific client to cater my design towards. However, I didn’t want to design a product for everyone-- or else it would be interesting to no one. So I chose to design for someone I knew really well.</p> <br>

    <p>I began designing for myself. This allowed me to get as much information I could about what I needed in the limited time we had. I’m a pretty lazy person, and I like to sleep, and not reach for anything too far away from me. I’m also incredibly forgetful, and I tend to ignore the reminders I write down. Following these simple guidelines, I began designing accessories that could aid me in my daily life.</p> <br>

    <p> Some of the more interesting ideas included a safety cowl and glasses that changed states depending on the situation it was in. But the idea I decided to develop further was the reminder clip. The initial idea of the reminder clip was a clip that vibrates when you forget something that you normally have with you, such as your phone or wallet.</p> <br>

    <p> Over time that idea developed into a hat, and once the kinks were ironed out, it became something more than just a hat that vibrates.</p> <br>

    <h1 id="designchoices">Design Choices</h1>

    <p>It was clear to me that this experience would be much better with headphones on, as the surrounding sounds would be much more immersive compared to a mono speaker on most phones, and better without external noises. Knowing that a user would likely wear speakers for this experience, I decided that focusing a lot of my attention of the audio would be worth it. I added eerie background music that was not too intrusive of the user's experience, as well as ambient sounds, such as some sounds of nature, radio static, etc.</p> <br>

    <p>Instead of real kittens from another video source, I found that using 3D models from the Unity store were much easier to add to the video. This prompted me to find a new video that was less realistic in order to keep consistency. Luckily, when I tested this with a couple of friends, I found that the atmosphere that I was aiming for did not change much, if at all.</p> <br>

    <h1 id="futureiterations">Future Iterations</h1>

    <p>I initially thought about using another device as a controller for a flashlight object, that would allow the user to control which parts of the video are visible, but because of time constraints, implementation of that was not possible. Instead, I had a light where the user was looking, while everywhere else was dark.</p> <br>

    <p>One of the interactions I wanted to implement was when the user's heartrate would effect when or how often jump scares happened. Another idea I had was how quickly the user turned their heads when a random sound played. While the details of how either would work would need to be flushed out more, I do think that one more user interaction would add another layer to this experience.</p> <br>

    <p>The goal of the environment, both with visuals and audio, was to build up suspense for the user before the jump scare happened. I intended on adding puppies and other cute creatures as well as kittens, but because of time constraints, I only implemented kittens. If I had another week or two, I would have added those, as well as several more sites for the user to have this experience in, such as a haunted house or the mountains.</p> <br>
